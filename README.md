# Rectangular-domain-FVM
This MATLAB tool solves 2D conservation equations for a square domain using a compound-interest grid. To solve a general 2nd order PDE encountered in fluid dynamics, please start by referring to "Discretization in 2nd order.pdf". To solve for a speacial case of a 4th order PDE (where the square of a laplacian equals a function of the two co-ordinates), start by referring to "Discretization in 4th order.pdf".
